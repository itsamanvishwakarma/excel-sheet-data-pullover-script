# Excel Data Update Script

This script helps you automatically update the "Physical Count" data in your Secondary Excel file using information from a Primary Excel file. Here's a simple guide to how it works:

---

## üéØ **Purpose**

- Copies "Physical Count" numbers from the **Primary Excel File** to the **Secondary Excel File** when matching items are found.
- If no match is found, it writes "NA" in the Secondary file to indicate missing data.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Prerequisites**

1. **Install Python**: If not already installed, download from [python.org](https://www.python.org).
2. **Install Required Tools** (Run these commands in Command Prompt/Terminal):
   ```
   pip install pandas openpyxl
   ```

---

## üîß **Configuration**

Update these settings in the script **BEFORE running**:

1. **Primary File Path**: Location of your source Excel file (e.g., `C:\Users\...\primary.xlsx`).
2. **Primary Sheet Name**: Name of the sheet in the Primary file (default: `Sheet1`).
3. **Secondary File Path**: Location of your target Excel file (e.g., `C:\Users\...\secondary.xlsx`).
4. **Secondary Sheet Name**: Name of the sheet in the Secondary file (default: `Sheet1`).

---

## üîÑ **How It Works**

1. **Load Data**:
   - Reads the Primary and Secondary Excel files.
   - Focuses on columns **Item Name (C)**, **Color (D)**, **Opening Qty (E)**, and **Physical Count (Q)**.
2. **Match Rows**:
   - Looks for rows with the same **Item Name + Color + Opening Qty** in both files.
3. **Update or Flag**:
   - If a match is found: Copies the "Physical Count" from Primary to Secondary.
   - If no match is found: Writes "NA" in the Secondary file.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è **Usage**

1. Place your Primary and Secondary Excel files in the correct folders.
2. Update the configuration settings in the script (file paths and sheet names).
3. Run the script:
   ```
   python script_name.py
   ```
4. Check the Secondary Excel file for updates.

---

## üìä **Output Explanation**

After running the script, you‚Äôll see:

- A list of updated rows with details.
- A summary like:
  ```
  Total updates made: 25
  Total rows with no matches (set to NA): 5
  ```

---

## Thing to to after running the script

- Go to the place where data is updated in the secondary file and check if the data is updated correctly.
- This script is paste the data one column to the left from where it supposed to paste (`Pease consider that in mind`).
- And also this Script will paste the data one Cell above from where it supposed to paste (`Pease consider that in mind`).
- Simple add another cell to the top.

## üìù **Notes**

- **Backup Your Files**: Always make a copy of your Excel files before running the script.
- **Close Excel Files**: Ensure both Primary and Secondary files are closed during the script run.
- **Formatting**: The script preserves Excel formatting (colors, formulas, etc.).

---

## üö® **Troubleshooting**

- **"File Not Found" Error**: Double-check the file paths in the configuration.
- **Data Not Updating**: Ensure the Item Name, Color, and Opening Qty columns match exactly in both files.
- **"NA" in All Rows**: This means no matches were found. Verify the data in both files.

## üîÑ **How to Use This Script with Other Excel Files in the Future**

If you need to run this script with **new/different Excel files**, follow these simple steps:

---

### üìÇ **1. Update File Paths & Sheet Names**

Open the script in a text editor (like Notepad) and modify these lines:

```python
# Configuration - Update these values according to your needs
PRIMARY_FILE_PATH = r'C:\NEW\PATH\TO\primary.xlsx'  # üñãÔ∏è Change this to your new Primary file path
PRIMARY_SHEET_NAME = 'Sheet1'                       # üñãÔ∏è Update if the sheet name changes
SECONDARY_FILE_PATH = r'C:\NEW\PATH\TO\secondary.xlsx'  # üñãÔ∏è Change this to your new Secondary file path
SECONDARY_SHEET_NAME = 'Sheet1'                     # üñãÔ∏è Update if the sheet name changes
```

Replace the file paths (e.g., `C:\NEW\PATH\TO\...`) with the actual locations of your new Excel files.

---

### üî¢ **2. Check Column Positions (If Needed)**

The script uses specific columns to match data:

- **Primary File**: Columns **C (Item Name)**, **D (Color)**, **E (Opening Qty)**, **Q (Physical Count)**.
- **Secondary File**: Columns **C (Item Name)**, **D (Color)**, **E (Opening Qty)**, **Q (Physical Count)**.

‚ö†Ô∏è **If your new Excel files have columns in different positions**:

1. Open the script and find these lines:
   ```python
   # For Primary File
   usecols=[2, 3, 4, 16]  # C=2, D=3, E=4, Q=16
   # For Secondary File
   usecols=[2, 3, 4, 17]  # C=2, D=3, E=4, Q=17
   ```
2. Adjust the numbers to match the new column positions (e.g., column A=0, B=1, C=2, etc.).

---

### üìú **3. Adjust Rows to Skip (If Headers Change)**

If your new Excel files have headers in different rows, update these lines:

```python
# For Primary File
skiprows=1,  # Skip the first 1 row (header starts at row 2)
# For Secondary File
skiprows=2,  # Skip the first 2 rows (header starts at row 3)
```

---

### üß™ **4. Test with New Files**

1. **Backup your new Excel files** before running the script.
2. Run the script and check the Secondary file to confirm updates.
